## DISCLAIMER

I made this app for me.  I'm sharing it so it may help others, but offer no support or expectation for updates.

## Running

It _should_ run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  I'm currently providing the source code only because I do not want to deal with proper binary compilation and OS permissions.
