## DISCLAIMER

I made this app for me.  I'm sharing it so it may help others, but offer no support or expectation for updates.

## Requirements

[ZSA's keymapp](https://blog.zsa.io/keymapp/) is required.

## Running

It _should_ run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  I'm currently providing the source code only because I do not want to deal with proper binary compilation and OS permissions.  Or bugs, feature requests, or anything.

It has not been properly tested and contains bugs and rough edges.
